Setup Database Structure:

Security Measure: Implement proper data sanitization and validation before inserting form submissions into the database to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Use prepared statements or WPDB methods to interact with the database securely.

Implement Form Submission Handling:

Security Measure: Validate and sanitize all form input data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and ensure data integrity.
Use WordPress functions like sanitize_text_field() and wp_kses() to sanitize user input.
Avoid directly executing user-submitted data in SQL queries.

Email Notifications:

Security Measure: Validate email addresses provided in the form to prevent email header injections and spam.
Use the is_email() function to validate email addresses before sending notifications.
Implement proper email headers and content to prevent email spoofing and ensure deliverability.
Consider using SMTP authentication for sending emails to improve security.

Create Plugin Pages:

Security Measure: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to plugin pages based on user roles and capabilities.
Use WordPress capabilities and roles to control who can access the plugin pages.
Sanitize and validate any user input on plugin pages to prevent XSS attacks and other vulnerabilities.

Frontend and Editor Block Enhancements:

Security Measure: Validate and sanitize user input within block attributes to prevent malicious code injection.
Use attribute sanitization functions provided by Gutenberg or custom sanitization functions as needed.
Regularly update block code and dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.

Testing:

Security Measure: Conduct security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
Follow WordPress security best practices and guidelines throughout development and testing.
Use security plugins like Wordfence or Sucuri to monitor and protect against security threats.

Documentation:

Security Measure: Include security considerations and recommendations in the plugin documentation for administrators and users.
Provide guidance on maintaining a secure WordPress environment and handling security incidents.
Encourage users to update the plugin and WordPress core regularly to patch security vulnerabilities.

Optimization and Refinement:

Security Measure: Continuously monitor and update the plugin to address security issues and improve overall security posture.
Implement security headers and measures, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and HTTP security headers, to mitigate common web security risks.
Stay informed about WordPress security advisories and apply recommended security measures promptly.

Plugin Update:

To implement plugin updates with automatic table creation, you'll need to handle versioning in your plugin.
Start by adding a version number to your plugin. This can be a constant defined in your main plugin file (boat-configurator.php), for example.
When you release an update to your plugin, increment the version number in your plugin file.
In your plugin's main file (boat-configurator.php), you can use WordPress hooks like plugins_loaded or admin_init to check the current plugin version against the version stored in the database. If the stored version is lower than the current version, perform any necessary update tasks, such as creating or updating database tables.
You'll also need to handle database table creation/update in your plugin activation hook (register_activation_hook()).

Frontend Enhancements:

For frontend enhancements like validation messages and a custom thank you page, you'll need to modify your block's JavaScript file (form_front_end.js) to include client-side form validation and to handle form submission.
You can use JavaScript to validate form fields before submission. If validation fails, display appropriate error messages to the user.
After successful form submission, you can redirect the user to a custom thank you page or display a thank you message directly on the page.
Remember to handle both client-side and server-side validation to ensure a smooth user experience.
